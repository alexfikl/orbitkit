Models
======

We include a selection of non-trivial models below, mainly inspired by
neuroscience. These are mostly meant for testing various other methods and
reproducing various papers.

If you need these models (or similar), there are many (e.g. neuroscience
focused) applications and libraries that are better suited and have more
examples. However, if additions are very welcome, especially if they exhibit
some new and exciting behavior that trips up any of the implemented data
analysis methods.
