.. warning::

   This package is currently in development and very experimental (the API
   can and will change frequently for the foreseeable future). This is also meant
   as a personal bag of tricks and will not necessarily be consistent or complete.

This is bag of random utilities that can be used to analyze and visualize
continuous dynamical systems. It will mainly grow as various needs arise and
it does not aim to be a general framework for dynamical systems.

There are many other frameworks that can be used for the general study of
dynamical systems, but they're usually a lot bigger. For some Python examples, see

* `simupy <https://github.com/simupy/simupy>`__:  A framework for modeling and
  simulating dynamical systems.
* `pynamical <https://github.com/gboeing/pynamical>`__: A package for modeling
  and visualizing discrete nonlinear dynamical systems, chaos, and fractals.
* `nolds <https://github.com/CSchoel/nolds>`__: Nonlinear measures for dynamical
  systems (based on one-dimensional time series).
* `pydse <https://github.com/blue-yonder/pydse>`__: A package for dynamic system
  estimation of time series.

However, there are many others in various programming languages.
`DynamicalSystems.jl <https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl>`__
is a particularly good example of state-of-the-art methods.
